<!--Next is the "tab" functionality.  Right before I call upon "nav.php" on each page
I set the variable '$section' to one of the 6 sections of the site.  Then, below, I have the function 'activate_tab' change the CLASS of each <td> to "tab" if it is within that
section.  (Because in my CSS file I have a different td.tab class called out, which
changes the cell background color to white.  Rinse and repeat for the six sections-->

      <h2>About Team DVzine</h2>
      <p>Alec, GCB and Frunch all attended <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/">Oberlin
College</a> in Ohio. In 1997 Frunch stumbled across The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Layout on the internet. Frunch told GCB about his discovery and the pair immediately set out to learn it. The following year Alec was quickly convinced that Dvorak was the only way to type.</p><p>As time passed, our now inseparable trio did their best to promote Dvorak's efficiency, health benefits, and simple beauty to friends, colleagues, and acquaintances. They used napkin-scrawled diagrams, enthusiastic rhetoric and dramatic gesticulations, but to little effect.  At the time, they felt they lacked the proper tools to communicate the simple elegance of Dvorak to the world. </p>
      <p>Then, in 2005 a friend suggested to Alec that he create a small zine about "something he really cared about." Alec immediately knew what he would do: "Of course! We'll use the power of COMICS to promote DVORAK!" Alec recruited Frunch and GCB and the trio began to develop, research and revise a script for the zine. Alec spent the spring of 2005 drawing and inking the zine while Frunch and GCB started working on this companion website.</p>
<p>Upon its launch, DVzine.org was immediately <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/14/126222">featured on Slashdot.org</a>, and garnered over 30,000 hits in just a few hours, until our server crashed.  In 2007 we were also <a href="https://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/10/dvorak-funnies-expla.html">featured on BoingBoing.net</a> which caused a similar influx of interest.</p>
     <p>In 2011 Alec, Frunch, and GCB changed the copyright of the Dvorak Zine to a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a> to help spread the message of The Dvorak Zine to as many typists as humanly possible! At the same time, they also launched a new <a href="https://dvzine.blogspot.com/">DVzine Blog</a> to answer questions about Dvorak and so they can continue to post new content which can be more easily shared around the internet.</p>
